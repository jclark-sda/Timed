# Timed

This application was developed specifically to help track work activity when there are too many small tasks and projects to take notes of time activity manually.

It also helps in productivity because you are encouraged to specifically think of which task is going to be undertaken. If used strictly (i.e. stopping that task in the software and changing over to another one) then I have found it helps focus tremendously.

There will be company specific items in this (e.g. the number of working hours per day or the pre-set tasks) however it is easily adaptable to your situation should you wish to use it.
